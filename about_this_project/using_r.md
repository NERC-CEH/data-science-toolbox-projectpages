# Including R Methods

For methods developed in `R`, documentation will often take the form of an `R Markdown` document, `Quarto` document, or package `vignette`. For inclusion in the Environmental Data Science Toolbox, however, methods are presented as Jupyter `.ipynb` notebooks, which can be executed using an R kernel. The approach is used so methods developed in `R`, `Python` and other languages are all visible in the same interface, promoting cross-language method discovery and knowledge sharing.


The guidance below describes how to make an R-based method available as a runnable Jupyter notebook, including the required R and Jupyter setup, dependency management, and registration of an R kernel.

## Requirements

Methods developed in **R** can be included in the Environmental Data Science Toolbox as `.ipynb` notebooks by using an **R Jupyter kernel**.

Before setting up the notebook, make sure you have:
- A working installation of R.
- A working installation of Jupyter.
- Jupyter available from the R session you will use to register the kernel.
- A way of opening and running Jupyter notebooks, such as VS Code with the Jupyter extension, JupyterLab, or another Jupyter-compatible interface.

> [!TIP]
> You can check whether Jupyter is visible from within an R terminal with: `Sys.which("jupyter")`. This should return the path to a Jupyter executable. If it returns an empty string, Jupyter is either not installed or is not available on the PATH inherited by the R session. You can make Jupyter accessible by first activating a UV or Conda environment with Jupyter installed before starting R: `conda activate <jupyter-environment>`.

## 1. Install the package and/or dependencies.
Start an R session and install the required package/dependencies for running the notebook. The exact installation approach may vary between projects. The important requirement is that all packages used by the notebook are available in the R session. 

For reproducibility, best practice is to include a `DESCRIPTION` file or to use `renv`. This will easily allow users to recreate the necessary environment for running the notebook.

## 2. Install and register an R Jupyter kernel.

Register the R environment you're in as an R kernel for use by the notebook. To do this we use `IRkernel`, which you'll have to install through `install.packages('IRkernel')`.

Register the R kernel:

```r
IRkernel::installspec(
    name = "notebookname-r",
    displayname = "R - notebookname"
)
```

This is normally a one-off setup step on each machine.

## 3. Create an .ipynb file and select the R kernel.

While several approaches exist for converting R markdown/quarto documents into Jupyter .ipynb notebooks, we recommend simply starting from fresh with the following [notebook template](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/data-science-toolbox/blob/main/notebook_guidance/template_notebook.ipynb) and copying across code/text. Ultimately, this is more efficient than troubleshooting issues with a direct conversion and it allows you to test the cells all run as expected. 

Open the [notebook template](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/data-science-toolbox/blob/main/notebook_guidance/template_notebook.ipynb) file in an interface such as VS Code with the Jupyter extension, JupyterLab, or another Jupyter-compatible interface. Select the R kernel registered in the previous step:
**Select Kernel → Jupyter Kernel → R - notebookname**

Notebooks use markdown(.md) and R code cells. Include general descriptive text in the markdown cells and include 
R code in specific R code cells. You can see and select the type of cell in the bottom right of the contents.

An `.ipynb` code cell should contain normal R code:

```r
fname <- here::here("inst", "extdata", "data.csv")
dt <- data.table::fread(fname)
```

Do not include R Markdown or Quarto chunk fences such as: *```{r}*.

## 6. Run the notebook cells and test from a clean clone

Before including the notebook in the Toolbox, test the complete workflow from a fresh clone:

```text
clone repository
→ install R dependencies
→ install the local R package
→ register IRkernel
→ open the notebook
→ select the R kernel
→ run all cells
```

This checks that the notebook does not depend on packages or configuration that are only present on the original developer's machine.
